# Nearmap Code Test

To run the app go to the root of the directory in your terminal and follow these steps:

1.  Run:
    ```terminal
    npm run serve
    ```
    This will spin up a [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) that will serve up the mock json data provided in the instructions.

2. Open up another terminal and run:
    ```terminal
    npm i && npm run start
    ```
    This will install all node dependencies and start up the react server. 

To run the tests open up another terminal and run:
```terminal
npm run test
```
